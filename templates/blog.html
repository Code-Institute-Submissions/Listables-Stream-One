                <p><br>Facebook is big. As the largest social network in the world, it has more than 1.23 billion active users, 62% of whom log in on a daily basis. Think about this: Facebook went from being unknown a little over a decade ago to billions of people using it today. <br><br>Has there ever been a success like Facebook? And perhaps more importantly, with that momentum, do you think there will be anything that will stop it? Will it go from billions of active users to millions or even thousands over the next decade? Probably not. Facebook is here to stay. And with such a large user base, ignoring Facebook really isn’t an option for most marketers. You can bet your ideal market is using Facebook nearly every day.<br><br>The question is: how do you target all of those users with your marketing? The good news is that the Facebook advertising platform allows you to zero in and specify the type of people you’re looking for. You can target by location, demographics, and interests. In this guide, I’ll show you the basics of how to use Facebook to your advantage. The guide is aimed at the beginner who wants an introduction into marketing their business on the world’s largest social network.<br><br>Facebook pages are similar to profiles, but for businesses, organizations, and public figures. Users can “Like” a page, which means they’ll automatically receive updates from that page in their news feed. Users also have the option to “Like” a page but not follow it. (Users also can follow some profiles.)<br><br> While profiles require a mutual relationship between friends, pages can be liked by anyone, without a requirement for the page creator to accept a fan. They also don’t have a restriction on the number of friends/fans they can have (unlike profiles, which are limited to 5,000 friends). Advantages: Pages are free and easy to set up. Disadvantages: It can be hard to get a foothold and build a fan base with a page.</p>
