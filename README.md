# Listables Media

## What is the Website for?

The website shown was part of a Code Institute Project. I chose to work with the scope of a media company that is showcasing their brand.
The website is to give potential clients a bit more info about the brand itself and provide some blog articles the visitor can read that gives,
them some free social media tips.

## Technologies Used

| Technology Name        | Description         | What I used it for |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) | Bootstrap gives the developer a grid like system to work with when using HTML. This allows for easier design and mobile compatibility. | I used Bootstrap to allow me to streamline the mobile and desktop designs and to ensure that they both were responsive no matter what device the user uses. |
|   [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)    | JQuery is a JavaScript library that makes the use of JavaScript a lot easier. JQuery provides the user with a feature-rich API, that is powerful yet easy to use.     | I used JQuery for my validation of the "Contact Us" form. The features already present in JQuery allowed me to implement the validation on each field in the form rather than just on final submission. |
| [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) | Animate.css provides the user with a CSS library that includes a wide variety of animations.      | I Animate.css to give the header of my pages a bit more life. The animations make the site feel less static and more engaging. |
| [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) | Google Fonts provides the user with a wide variety of Fonts that anyone can use to customize their project more. | I used Google Fonts to give the website a bit personality, by not just using generic windows fonts. |
