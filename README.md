# Listables Media

## What is the Website for?

The website shown was part of a Code Institute Project. I chose to work with the scope of a media company that is showcasing their brand.
The website is to give potential clients a bit more info about the brand itself and provide some blog articles the visitor can read that gives,
them some free social media tips.

You can see the live preview of the site here: https://heinrichhohbach.github.io/Listables-Stream-One/

## Technologies Used

| Technology Name        | Description         | What I used it for |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) | Bootstrap gives the developer a grid like system to work with when using HTML. This allows for easier design and mobile compatibility. | I used Bootstrap to allow me to streamline the mobile and desktop designs and to ensure that they both were responsive no matter what device the user uses. |
|   [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)    | JQuery is a JavaScript library that makes the use of JavaScript a lot easier. JQuery provides the user with a feature-rich API, that is powerful yet easy to use.     | I used JQuery for my validation of the "Contact Us" form. The features already present in JQuery allowed me to implement the validation on each field in the form rather than just on final submission. |
| [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) | Animate.css provides the user with a CSS library that includes a wide variety of animations.      | I Animate.css to give the header of my pages a bit more life. The animations make the site feel less static and more engaging. |
| [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) | Google Fonts provides the user with a wide variety of Fonts that anyone can use to customize their project more. | I used Google Fonts to give the website a bit personality, by not just using generic windows fonts. |
| [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) | QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code | I used QUnit to test some of my JQuery code. This helped me automate the testing process of those features. |

## Functionalities of the Website

The website is a basic media company type template. It provides the user with a website that shows all the basic information about the brand and has a blog section to allow the user to show some blog posts if needed.
The site also includes a jQuery powered "Contact Us" form that performs the validation of user input to ensure that the fields have the right information entered.

The "Services" section of the website uses a simple accordion JQuery item that allows the user to open and close sections of the site. This increases the readability of the content and adds an interactive aspect to the site itself.

## Testing 

Testing was peformed in two ways:

	1. The basic validation was tested using "QUnit". QUnit is an easy to use JQuery testing library. It helps to ensure that the JQuery code works correctly by automatically testing the functions.

	2. The website was also tested using "Chrome Developer tools". Chrome allowed me to see the website from various mobile and desktop screens, which helped with the styling of the website. Through using this tool, I could ensure that the visual aspects of the site are readible and are not buggy.

## Outside Influences

Outside influences for the project were:

	1. The basic website outline was influenced by parts of the course content and other media related websites I was able to find online. These websites helped me choose the design of the site and what pages the site should include.
	
	2. I used some text from https://blog.kissmetrics.com/facebook-marketing/ for the blog part of the website. No copyright infringement is intended and the content of the article itself belongs to the author on the website linked.
